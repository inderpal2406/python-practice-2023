# RSS Feeds are an easy way to stay up to date with your favorite websites,
# such as blogs or online magazines. If a site offers an RSS feed, you get
# notified whenever a post goes up, and then you can read a summary or the whole post.

# RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to
# websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.

# RSS: Really Simple Syndication.

# RSS: RSS(Rich Site Summary, often called Really Simple Syndication) uses a family of
# standard web feed formats to publish frequently updated informationlike blog entries,
# news headlines, audio, video. RSS is XML formatted plain text.

    # certificate in the chain, in base64 encoded pem file, won't work. Complete chain is needed.

    # chain of certs in base64 format of .pem file. Select that option.
    # Otherwise we need to export each certificate separately and then combine them into one
